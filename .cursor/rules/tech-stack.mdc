This document outlines the core technologies used across the Forsah platform:

* **Next.js** with **TypeScript** for a powerful, type‑safe React framework.
* **Tailwind CSS** (via [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)) for utility‑first styling and prebuilt UI primitives.
* **React Query** for data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
* **Zod** + **@hookform/resolvers/zod** for schema‑based validation in both server actions and form handling.
* **lucide‑react** for lightweight, customizable SVG icons.
* **sonner** for toast notifications and user feedback.

All packages are installed and configured per project standards, ensuring consistency and maintainability.
